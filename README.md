## Overview

Converse is a free and open-source XMPP chat client written in JavaScript which can be tightly integrated into any website.
The benefit of using converse.js as opposed to relying on a SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution, is that your users can have a much more customized, streamlined and integrated webchat experience and that you have control over the data. The latter being a requirement for many sites dealing with sensitive information.

- Open chats via URL
